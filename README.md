# Fuel Route Planner API üöó‚õΩ
loom video=https://youtu.be/VMiqT4fOPNw


A Django 3.2.23 API that calculates the optimal driving route between two U.S. locations and suggests fuel stops based on a 500-mile fuel range and current fuel prices. It also returns the total fuel cost based on 10 miles per gallon efficiency.

##  Features

-  Takes **start** and **end** location input
-  Returns a route using an external routing API (minimal API calls)
-  Identifies **optimal fuel stops** from provided fuel station data
-  Calculates **total fuel cost** based on distance and fuel prices
-  Efficient logic: Only one external API call is used to fetch the route
